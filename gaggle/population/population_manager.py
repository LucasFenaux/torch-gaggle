     To avoid wasteful computation, we optionally keep track of an individualâ€™s freshness and only 
     recompute its fitness if it was modified since its fitness was last computed.
     
     The Population Manager also provides a standardized interface for the evolutionary operators to access and update
     individuals. It stores all the individual-related meta-information required for the operators, such as which
     parents have been chosen, which individuals will be crossed over etc. This simplifies the operator pipeline by
     avoiding the need for operators to interface with each other directly.
